# Setup for my EMACS environment

To use, place the following lines in `~/.emacs`.

```
(setq user-init-file "~/repos/emacs-setup/.emacs")
(load user-init-file)
```

where `~/repos/emacs-setup` is the assumed local repository's location.

Note, `emacs.d` will just live in your home directory.

Feel free to comment, or suggest new things.
